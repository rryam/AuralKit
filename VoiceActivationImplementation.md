# Voice Activation Implementation Checklist

- [x] **Step 1 – Analyze Current Session Pipeline**
  - Reviewed `SpeechSession.swift`, `SpeechSession+Pipeline.swift`, and `SpeechSession+Audio.swift` to map analyzer setup, teardown, and audio streaming workflow.
  - Confirmed concurrency boundaries and actor isolation before integrating additional modules.

- [x] **Step 2 – Define Public API Surface**
  - Added `configureVoiceActivation` / `disableVoiceActivation`, `isVoiceActivationEnabled`, and `speechDetectorResultsStream` to `SpeechSession`.
  - Defaulted to `SpeechDetector.DetectionOptions(sensitivityLevel: .medium)` while preserving direct access to Apple's types.

- [x] **Step 3 – Manage Module Lifecycle**
  - Instantiated `SpeechDetector` alongside `SpeechTranscriber`, wiring both into the shared `SpeechAnalyzer`.
  - Ensured locale assets are provisioned via the updated `ModelManager.ensureAssets(for:)` helper and cleaned up detector state on teardown.

- [x] **Step 4 – Gate Transcription Flow**
  - Relied on the integrated `SpeechDetector` to coordinate voice-activated transcription inside the analyzer while tracking detector state through `isSpeechDetected`.
  - Prepared for future policy hooks by keeping detector state accessible to session consumers.

- [x] **Step 5 – Surface Optional VAD Events**
  - Created an optional `AsyncStream<SpeechDetector.Result>` that activates when `reportResults` is requested, with continuations managed by `prepareSpeechDetectorResultsStream` / `tearDownSpeechDetectorStream`.
  - Subscribed to detector results in `startSpeechDetectorMonitoring` to keep clients informed of speech activity.

- [x] **Step 6 – Error Handling & Recovery**
  - Captured detector-stream failures, logging and resetting session state without disrupting the transcription stream.
  - Guaranteed session cleanup resets detector monitoring and restores `isSpeechDetected` defaults.

- [x] **Step 7 – Tests & Verification**
  - Added `testVoiceActivationConfiguration` to `AuralKitTests` to cover state transitions.
  - Executed `swift build` and `swift test` to validate the feature end-to-end.

- [x] **Step 8 – Documentation & Release Prep**
  - Summarized the implementation plan in this checklist and captured the work in PR [#11](https://github.com/rryam/AuralKit/pull/11).
